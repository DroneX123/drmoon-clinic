# Agent Instructions

## Operating Principles
1. **Frontend First:** We are building a React + Tailwind + Vite app.
2. **Directives:** Always read the files in `directives/` before coding.
3. **Safety Latch:** Before making complex changes, run: `git add . && git commit -m "Checkpoint"` so we can undo if you break it.

## File Structure
- `src/components/ui`: Reusable components (Buttons, Cards).
- `directives/`: Your instructions (SOPs).
